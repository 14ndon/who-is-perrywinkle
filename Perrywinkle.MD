Perrywinkle is a multimedia visionary art project I started back in 2020. The spirit of Perrywinkle is a fairy-tale like blend of the whimsical, the mystical, and the alien. It seeks to push boundaries through personal revelation and experimentation with new technologies.

On this website you will find greater context and clues for experiencing Perrywinkle projects, which hopefully still leave room for personal interpretation.

You can tune into Perrywinkle across various platforms with the linktree below:

## Album

Wake Up The Machine is the latest Perrywinkle album. It is about the self-reprogramming that occurs through the creative process. An awakening to neglected desires, overcoming of limiting beliefs, and a learning to navigate disappointments and uncertainty. It was created entirely by me, from the songwriting to the production to the cover art.

Highlights: Wake Up The Machine, Inner Engineering.

## The Anomaly Music Video

Music video I made for my song, "The Anomaly". The song itself is about making room for intuition and improvisation, learning to follow your instincts. It was filmed in South America as I was traveling with my friends.

Originally the idea was to try and get strangers to dance with me, to start an impromptu flashmob, but I ended up moving too erratically for people to know how to interact with me. However, I don't think I could have done it any other way.

The glitchy effects ended up being an afterthought.

# Dark Seed

Dark Seed is the first Perrywinkle album, walking the line between psychosis and spiritual emergence. Inspired by Carl Jung's ideas of the shadow, it parodies the New Age idea of "star seeds"â€“individuals who believe their souls originated from other planets, who feel they are on Earth to help humanity and the planet evolve spiritually. It posits that in order to exhibit "star seed"-like qualities, we must first acknowledge and integrate the madness within ourselves.
